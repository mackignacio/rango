*The name "**Rango**" comes from the animated adventure comedy film released in 2011. The story follows a chameleon named Rango, voiced by the legendary actor Johnny Depp. However, it's worth noting that "Rango" is originally a Spanish word that means "range" or "to range." It seems that the movie title "Rango" is also the same in Tagalog and has been kept as is, possibly due to its original Spanish origin.*

### Creating a Basic RangoJS Server

Well, howdy, cowboy coder! Now that we've got RangoJS lassoed and ready, it's high time to build ourselves a sturdy corral for our code. So, saddle up and crack open that trusty text editor or IDE of yours - the one that feels like an old friend.

With your cowboy hat on tight, let's wrangle some code and create a basic server that'll stand tall like a strong, dependable stallion. Get ready to ride the RangoJS wave and blaze the trail in this digital frontier! Just follow the steps below, cowboy!

1. Create a new file named **app.ts** in the project root directory.

2. In **app.ts**, add the following code:

    ```ts
    // Import RangoJS
    import rango from "rango";

    // Create an instance of the RangoJS app
    const app = rango();

    // Define a route for the home page
    app.add({
      path: "",
      GET: () => {
        return "Hello, RangoJS!";
      }
    });

    // Start the server
    const port = 3000;
    app.listen(port, () => {
      console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
    });
    ```

> [See the full code here.](https://github.com/mackignacio/rango/blob/main/example/basic/getting-started/README.md)

### Starting the RangoJS Server

To kickstart that trusty server, just mosey on over to your terminal and wrangle up this command:

```sh
nodemon app.ts
```

Now that our trusty server's up and running, it's time to hitch our wagon to the trail and see what RangoJS has rustled up for us! Head on over to your web browser, and pay a visit to this link:

> [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

There, right before your very eyes, you'll find the message **"Hello, RangoJS!"** all shiny and gleaming like the stars in the night sky. Ain't that something? RangoJS sure knows how to make an impression!

## Yeehaw! Code Cowboy

You've successfully set up a RangoJS project, created a basic server, and sent a response to a user request. Now you can dive deeper into RangoJS and explore its powerful features to build robust and sophisticated web applications.

### **Happy gunslinging and coding, Code Cowboy! ðŸŒµðŸ¤ ðŸš€**

Saddle up and let your code roam free like a wild mustang, breaking new ground and blazing trails in this digital frontier. Ride with the wind in your hair and the thrill in your heart as you wrangle them bugs and rope up them features. Keep your eyes on the horizon, 'cause the sky's the limit when you're a code cowboy! So kick back, relax, and enjoy the ride with RangoJS as your trusty sidekick.

## Understanding the Code

Let's break down the code in your **app.ts**.

We imported the RangoJS module using `import rango from 'rango'`.

We created an instance of the RangoJS application with `const app = rango()`.

We defined a route for the home page using

```ts
app.add({
  path: "",
  GET: () => {
    return "Hello, RangoJS!";
  },
})
```

When a user accesses the root URL (i.e., /), the provided callback function is executed, and the response **"Hello, RangoJS!"** is sent back. RangoJS automatically detects the returned data from the callback and assign the correct `content-type` in the header.

We started the server on `port 3000` using

```ts
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

The server is now running and ready to handle incoming requests.

To test each method, you can use tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or using a frontend application built from `React` or `Angular` that sends requests to your server using various methods.

Well, now that you've got your spurs on, it's time to ride into unexplored territories and uncover the boundless capabilities that RangoJS has in store for you. Keep your eyes peeled as you mosey on ahead to discover all the remarkable things RangoJS can do for ya.

## Single Route with Multiple HTTP Methods

Now, let's create a single route that supports multiple HTTP methods (**GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **DELETE**, and **DELETE**). We'll handle each method differently based on the action we want to perform using a `callback` function. We call these callback function route `endpoints`.

In **app.ts**, update the `app.add` function and add the following code:

```ts
app.add({
    path: "users",
    GET: () => {
      // Logic to handle GET request for '/users'
      return "This is a GET request!";
    },
    POST: () => {
      // Logic to handle POST request for '/users'
      return "This is a POST request!";
    },
    PUT: () => {
      // Logic to handle PUT request for '/users'
      return "This is a PUT request!";
    },
    PATCH: () => {
      // Logic to handle PATCH request for '/users'
      return "This is a PATCH request!";
    },
    DELETE: () => {
      // Logic to handle DELETE request for '/users'
      return "This is a DELETE request!";
    },
});
```

In this example, we use a common name for each `HTTP Methods` (**GET**, **POST**, **PUT**, **PATCH**, and **DELETE**) as function to handle all the supported HTTP methods. This makes your application more flexible and efficient, as it can perform different actions based on the HTTP method used and managing it in one place.

> [See the full code here.](https://github.com/mackignacio/rango/blob/main/example/basic/single-route/README.md)

## Why this Approach in Routing

In Express.js, there are two ways to define routes to handle HTTP requests: using individual route methods (**app.get**, **app.post**, etc.) or using a single route method (**app.all**) to handle multiple HTTP methods. Let's compare the two approaches and discuss their use cases:

### Individual Route Methods (app.get, app.post, etc.)

With individual route methods, you define separate route handlers for each specific HTTP method:

```ts
// Using individual route methods
app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to handle GET request for '/users'
  res.send('GET request for /users');
});

app.post('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to handle POST request for '/users'
  res.send('POST request for /users');
});

app.put('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to handle PUT request for '/users'
  res.send('PUT request for /users');
});

app.patch('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to handle PATCH request for '/users'
  res.send('PATCH request for /users');
});

app.delete('/users', (req, res) => {
  // Logic to handle DELETE request for '/users'
  res.send('DELETE request for /users');
});
```

### Single Route Method (app.all)

With the single route method approach, you use **app.all** to define a route that handles all HTTP methods:

```ts
// Using a single route method
const handleUsersRequest = (req, res) => {
  switch (req.method) {
    case 'GET':
      // Logic to handle GET request for '/users'
      res.send('GET request for /users');
      break;
    case 'POST':
      // Logic to handle POST request for '/users'
      res.send('POST request for /users');
      break;
    case 'PUT':
      // Logic to handle PUT request for '/users'
      res.send('PUT request for /users');
      break;
    case 'PATCH':
      // Logic to handle PATCH request for '/users'
      res.send('PATCH request for /users');
      break;
    case 'DELETE':
      // Logic to handle DELETE request for '/users'
      res.send('DELETE request for /users');
      break;
    default:
      res.status(405).send('Method not allowed!');
  }
};

app.all('/users', handleUsersRequest);
```

### Which Approach to Choose?

The choice between individual route methods and the single route method approach depends on the complexity and organization of your application.

Use **Individual Route Methods** when you have different actions and significant logic for each HTTP method and want the code to be more explicit.

Use the **Single Route Method** when you have shared logic between multiple HTTP methods and want a more concise and DRY codebase.

By combining the Individual Route Methods approach and the Single Route Method approach in one. RangoJS can provide a balanced and flexible approach to handling HTTP requests. By using both approaches strategically, you can take advantage of their respective strengths and address their limitations.

### Pros of Combining both Approaches in RangoJS

- **Explicitness**: Each HTTP method has its dedicated route handler, making the code easier to read and understand.

- **Granular Control**: You can handle different HTTP methods differently, which is useful when the actions vary significantly for each method.

- **No Code Duplication**: If you have shared logic between different methods, you don't need to duplicate the code across multiple route handlers, leading to  DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

- **Decreased Number of Route Handlers**: For complex applications with many routes and methods, the number of individual route handlers can grow significantly, making the codebase larger and harder to manage. Managing each route handler in a single `routeObject` makes it easier.

- **Code Reusability**: With this approach, you can centralize the shared logic for multiple HTTP methods within a single route object.

- **Conciseness**: The codebase can be more concise with fewer route handlers, especially when handling similar actions for different HTTP methods.

Overall, combining the Individual Route Methods approach and the Single Route Method approach allows you to create a well-structured and maintainable application. By choosing the appropriate approach for each route based on the complexity and similarity of actions, you can achieve a codebase that is both expressive and efficient.
