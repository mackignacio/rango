*The name "**Rango**" comes from the animated adventure comedy film released in 2011. The story follows a chameleon named Rango, voiced by the legend actor Johnny Depp. However, it's worth noting that "Rango" is originally a Spanish word that means "range" or "to range." It seems that the movie title "Rango" is also the same in Tagalog and has been kept as is, possibly due to its original Spanish origin.*

## Getting Started Guide

### Prerequisites

Before diving into RangoJS, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

1. Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from the official website: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

2. npm (Node Package Manager): npm comes bundled with Node.js. However, it's essential to have the latest version. To update npm, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```sh
    npm install -g npm
    ```

### Setting up a New RangoJS Project

Let's begin by setting up a new RangoJS project. Follow these steps:

1. Create a new project directory:

    ```sh
    mkdir my-rangojs-api
    cd my-rangojs-api
    ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:

    ```sh
    npm init -y
    ```

3. Install RangoJS:

    ```sh
    npm install rango
    ```

4. Install Typescript:

    ```sh
    npm install typescript ts-node -D
    ```

5. Install Nodemon:

    ```sh
    npm install nodemon -D
    ```

### Creating a Basic RangoJS Server

Now that we have RangoJS installed, it's time to create a basic server. Open your favorite text editor or IDE and create a new file named **app.ts**.

In **app.ts**, add the following code:

```ts
// Import the RangoJS and http module
import rango from "rango";
import http from "http";

// Create an instance of the RangoJS app
const app = rango();

// Define a route for the home page
app.add({
  path: "/",
  GET: () => {
    return "Hello, RangoJS!";
  }
});

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
http.createServer(app).listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}.`);
});
```

## Starting the RangoJS Server

To start the server, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
nodemon app.ts
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser, and you should see the message **"Hello, RangoJS!"** displayed on the page.

## Understanding the Code

Let's break down the code in **app.js**:

We imported the RangoJS module using `import rango from 'rango'`.

We created an instance of the RangoJS app with `const app = rango()`.

We defined a route for the home page using

```ts
app.add({
  path: "",
  GET: () => {
    return "Hello, RangoJS!";
  },
})
```

When a user accesses the root URL (i.e., /), the provided callback function is executed, and the response **"Hello, RangoJS!"** is sent back. RangoJS automatically detects the returned data from the callback and assign the correct `content-type` in the header.

We started the server on `port 3000` using

```ts
const port = 3000;
http.createServer(app).listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${port}.`);
});
```

The server is now running and ready to handle incoming requests.
