# Middlewares

In RangoJS, middleware plays a vital role in managing and processing incoming HTTP requests before they reach the route handlers. Middleware functions are executed in the order they are defined, allowing you to perform various tasks such as authentication, logging, data parsing, error handling, and more.

## What is Middleware?

A middleware, in the context of RangoJS, are functions that have access to the `requestObject` and `responseObjects` inside the `Context` object and the `next()` function. They can modify the request and response objects, terminate the request-response cycle, or pass control to the next middleware in the stack.

## Using Middleware

To use middleware in RangoJS, you can employ the `app.use()` method or specify middleware functions directly in your route definitions. The order of middleware registration matters, as they are executed sequentially. This is similar to what Express.js implements on their API.
