## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mackignacio/rango.git
   cd example/advance/todo
   ```

2. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the server:

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

    The server will start on port `3000` by default. You can configure the port in the **app.ts** file.

2. Open your preferred API testing tool (such as `Postman` or `Insomnia`).
3. Use the provided API endpoints to interact with the TODO API.

## API Endpoints

- `GET` **/todo** : Get a list of all **TODO** tasks.
- `GET` **/todo/:id** : Get details of a specific **TODO** task.
- `POST` **/todo** : Create a new **TODO** task.
- `PUT` **/todo/:id** : Update an existing **TODO** task.
- `DELETE` **/todo/:id** : Delete a **TODO** task.

For more detailed information on `request` and `response` formats, refer to the API documentation in the [api-docs](https://github.com/mackignacio/rango/tree/main/example#request-and-response-handling) folder.
