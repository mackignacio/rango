# RangoJS Project Documentation: Unit Testing with Jest

Unit testing is an essential practice in software development that helps ensure the reliability and correctness of your code. Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework that simplifies the process of writing and running unit tests. This documentation will guide you through setting up and using Jest for unit testing in your project.

## Mocking

Jest provides powerful mocking capabilities for simulating external dependencies and functions. You can mock modules, functions, and objects to isolate your tests. Learn more in the Jest documentation.

## Best Practices

- Write focused, isolated unit tests for individual functions or modules.
- Use descriptive test and suite names.
- Keep your test files organized in a dedicated directory (e.g., __tests__).
- Strive for high test coverage to ensure comprehensive testing.
- Regularly update and maintain your tests as your codebase evolves.

With Jest, unit testing becomes a straightforward and efficient part of your development workflow, enhancing code quality and reliability. Refer to the Jest documentation for detailed information and advanced usage.
