Introduction
============

RangoJS is a powerful and flexible web framework for Node.js, designed to create web applications and APIs with ease. This documentation aims to provide examples and information about using RangoJS to build robust web applications.

Prerequisites
=============

To use RangoJS, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **`Node.js`** is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. You can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org).

    To verify that Node.js is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

    ```sh
    node -v
    ```

    It should display the installed Node.js version.

2. **`npm`** (Node Package Manager) is a package manager that comes bundled with Node.js and allows you to install and manage various packages and dependencies for your Node.js projects.

    To check if npm is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    npm -v
    ```
    It will show the installed npm version.
